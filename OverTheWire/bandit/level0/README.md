So, the first thing to do here is to use `ssh` to tunnel to the challenge server.

The following command demonstrates how `ssh` is used to connect to a remote server
`ssh <username>@<host>`

Let's connect!

`ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org` and at the password prompt, we supply the password `bandit0`

```
┌─[x509@infosploit] - [~/.gconf/apps] - [2016-02-23 08:32:59]
└─[0] <> ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

```

Upon tunneling into the server, the first and obvious thing to do is list the contents of the directory:

`bandit0@melinda:~$ ls -al`

It appears to have a readme file in the directory, let's dump the contents to STDOUT using the `cat` command:

```
bandit0@melinda:~$ cat readme
boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
bandit0@melinda:~$
```

This is our password for the `bandit1` account!
